# Testing
- Functionality testing:
I used Microsoft Edge's developer tools for testing, problem solving problems issues and different screen sizes(inc mobile devices) 
- To ensure the project adheres to web standards, I 
have validated the CSS using the W3C CSS Validator. The following badge indicates that our CSS is valid:
- <p>
    <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/check/referer">
        <img style="border:0;width:88px;height:31px"
            src="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/images/vcss"
            alt="Valid CSS!" />
    </a>
</p>

- sign up using social media.

- User-generated content: so that users can participate in community discussions.

- Social media integration: Adding social media integration would allow users to easily share posts on their social media accounts and increase the site's visibility.

- Multi-language support: Adding multi-language support would allow the site to reach a wider audience and provide content in different languages for users who prefer to read articles in languages other than English.

- Newsletter Subscription - Allow users to subscribe to a newsletter that features latest event and updates.

- Interactive Maps - Create interactive maps with points of interest or travel routes that users can click on to access articles and information.

<br>

- Issue: collapsing navbar wasn't workig correctly and in the end couldnt get it to collapse after exanding.

  - Solution: Eventually got it to expand by deleteing the whole nav bar section and coding it out again. used a video from the youtube channel "thenewboston" but as the video was 6 years old, i could only get the navbar to expand when clicked but would not collapse if clicked again.

<br>

- Issue: game.html file wasn't loading my script.js adn was receiving server eroor 500 after i had debug off.

<br>

- Issue: AttributeError at /event-test-this-is-the-slug/ c'ManyToManyDescriptor' object has no attribute 'filter'
